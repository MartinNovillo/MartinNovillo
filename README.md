# Hi there!

I'm Martin. A software developer in progress and a musician by nature.

Currenlty, i'm pursuing a [technical degree in Software Development](https://www.ifts18.edu.ar/carreras/tsds/plan-tsds) at a public Educational Institute in Buenos Aires.


In this repo you'll find little part of my progress as a student. 


There is something that i can do for you? 
My tools of the trade are primarly **Python** and **SQL**
I'm a fast and enthusiastic learner. Just get in touch with me!
